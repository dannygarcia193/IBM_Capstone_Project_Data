Hello this is my submission to the IBM captone project assignment. There are a few things I hsould mention bekfore you open the file. 
The first is that, my notebook does not render correctly on GitHub so please follow the link to the Google Collab notebook that is provided.
If that doesn't redirect you correctly, use this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Mo5-6U3MxpAk05eU9camXflUxNbJgBkj.
There you should find a fully workable and rendered version of my Jupyter Notebook for this project. 
Also, I left the names for the data files as is, so they are somewhat cryptic. See my notebook for reference as to what these files pertain to. 
Lastly, there are three components that I've submitted: a report, a powepoint presentation, the notebook (which contain the url for my 
Google Colab notebook), and the data files used for this project. 
Thanks and should you have any question regarding my submission, feel free to email me at dannygarcia193@gmail.com
